# 🧠 Lesson 1: Getting Started with Robot Programming

Welcome to your first robotics coding lesson! In Lesson 1, you’ll learn how to write simple code to make your robot move forward and backward. This is the foundation for everything else you'll do in robotics!

---

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- How to write basic robot code using Java.
- How to make your robot drive forward.
- How to make your robot turn (bonus points).
- How to test your code in the VRS simulator.

## 🚗 What Does the Robot Do?

In this lesson, your robot will:

1. Drive forward for a few seconds.
2. Stop.
3. BONUS: make your robot spin in a circle.

It’s like teaching your robot to take a few steps forward!

## 🚀 How to Run Your Code

1. Go to the [VRS simulator](https://www.vrobotsim.online/level1.html) and open **Level 1**.
2. Click **On Bot Java** to open the code editor.
3. Copy and paste the starter code into a new class.
4. Try writing the code to make your robot move!
5. Use **Initialize Program** and **Run Program** to test it out.
