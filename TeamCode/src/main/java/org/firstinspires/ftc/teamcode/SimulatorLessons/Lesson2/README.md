# 🤖 Lesson 2: Making Your Robot Move

Welcome to Lesson 2! In this activity, you'll learn two cool ways to make your robot drive on its own—like a self-driving car!

---

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- How to make your robot move using **time** (like a stopwatch).
- How to make your robot move using **encoders** (like a built-in measuring tool).
- Which method works better and why.
- What a "variable" is and why you might want to use them.

## 🛣️ Start Here: Time-Based Movement

Begin with the **time-based** code. This is the easiest way to get your robot moving and is a continuation of what you've already learned from VRS Lesson 1.

### How it works

- You tell the robot to drive for a certain number of seconds.
- It moves forward, then stops when the time is up.

🕒 Example: “Drive forward for 2 seconds.”

### Try these files

- `Lesson2_time_based_starter.java`
- `Lesson2_time_based_the_solution.java`

## 📏 Next Level: Encoder-Based Movement

Once you're comfortable with time-based movement, try using **encoders**!

### What are encoders?

Encoders are like rulers inside your robot’s motors. They measure how far the wheels turn so your robot can move the exact distance you want.

📐 Example: “Drive forward exactly 24 inches.”

- `Lesson2_encoder_based_starter.java`
- `Lesson2_encoder_based_the_solution.java`

## 🆚 Time vs. Encoders

| Feature         | Time-Based Movement        | Encoder-Based Movement       |
|-----------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| How it works    | Uses a timer               | Uses motor measurements      |
| Easy to use?    | ✅ Yes                     | ⚠️ A little harder           |
| Accurate?       | ❌ Not always              | ✅ Very accurate             |
| Best for...     | Quick tests                | Real competitions            |

## 🚀 How to Run Your Code

1. Open the VRS simulator and go to Level 2.
2. Click **On Bot Java** to open the code editor.
3. Start with the time-based starter file.
4. Test your robot and see how it moves!
5. Then try the encoder-based code and compare the results.
